# electron-react-loopback-example
Example showing the isomorphic client for loopback inside an electron app using react &amp; babel.

## Uses:

Electron JSX Babel Boilerplate as a simple electron starting point:
https://github.com/Quramy/electron-jsx-babel-boilerplate

The server/ app is generated by the ``slc loopback`` generator.

- Browserifies the loopback client service in the electron client, while avoiding the babel compiler, using some simple gulp craftiness.
- Also I think the npm file: dependency helps for electron (see client/package.json) but I'm not sure yet.

## To run it:

You will need to run two shells (I will simplify this shortly)

1. in client/, ``npm install`` and then run ``gulp watch`` to run it.
2. in server/, ``npm install`` and then the usual ``node .`` to run that.

## TODO:
- [ ] Improve isomorphic client loading (instead of loading in html, use es6 possibly)
- [ ] Re-enable gulp watch/electron-connect happiness
- [ ] Figure out **exactly** what is needed to run the ismorphic client (there could be a lot of loose ends here)
- [ ] Finish repo griddle example
- [ ] Do a redux or flux example to implement the todo app.
- [ ] Build schema for indexing
